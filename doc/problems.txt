This folder contains the three example problems described in the 
MODFLOW-USG user manual.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS

01A_nestedgrid_nognc -- example problem with a nested grid.

01B_nestedgrid_gnc -- example problem with a nested grid demonstrating
    the use of the ghost node correction package.

02_quadtree -- example problem patterned after the Biscayne aquifer.  
    This problem uses a quadtree grid.  The datasets for this problem 
    are too large to include in this distribution, but a zip file of
    the datasets can be obtained from: 
    
    http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/mfusg/02_quadtree.zip

    ***If you have python installed on your computer, you may be able 
    to run get_ex02.py to download and unzip this example problem.***

03_conduit_confined -- example problem demonstrating use of the CLN 
    Process with a structured MODFLOW grid.  The confined example is 
    included here.

03A_conduit_unconfined -- Similar to 03_conduit_confined, but 
    unconfined and with two CLN Process nodes.

03B_conduit_unconfined -- Similar to 03_conduit_confined, but 
    unconfined and with one CLN Process node.

03C_conduit_unconfined -- Similar to 03_conduit_confined, but 
    unconfined and with two CLN Process nodes with the confined (fully 
    saturated) flow option for the well.

03D_conduit_unconfined -- Similar to 03_conduit_confined, but 
    unconfined and with one CLN Process node and the "flow-to-dry-
    cell" option.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING

A batch file for running the test is located in in each folder.  Each
folder also contains output, which can be compared with the
simulation results to make sure that the program is giving
the expected results.
